```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
```


```{r}
ces <- read_csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
```

## Graph
```{r}
ggplot(ces, aes(x = white_percent, y = ces_3_0_score))+
  geom_hex()+
  labs(x="White Population (%)",
       y="CalEnviroScreen 3.0 Pollution Burden Score",
       title="CalEnviroScreen pollution burden score on white population")+
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "navy", high = "orange") +
  theme_minimal()
```


There appears to be a negative relationship between white population and pollution burden score: as the white population increases, the pollution burden score decreases.
